    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language used to create web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page by using tags. Tags are instructions that tell a web browser how to display the content of a web page.</p>
    <p>HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;. The opening tag tells the browser that the content within the tag is a heading. The closing tag tells the browser that the heading is finished.</p>
    <p>HTML is a very simple language to learn. There are many online tutorials and resources that can help you learn HTML. Once you have learned the basics of HTML, you can start creating your own web pages.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>CSS is used to control the appearance of web pages, such as the font, color, and layout of text, as well as the size and position of images. CSS can also be used to create animations and other effects.</p>   
    <p>CSS is a rule-based language. You define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript is used to create interactive web pages, such as those with dropdown menus, animated graphics, and drag-and-drop functionality.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that it runs on the user's computer, not on the web server. This makes JavaScript very fast and responsive, as it does not have to wait for the web server to send back a response.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can be used to create a wide variety of interactive web pages. It is a relatively easy language to learn, and there are many online resources available to help you get started.</p>
